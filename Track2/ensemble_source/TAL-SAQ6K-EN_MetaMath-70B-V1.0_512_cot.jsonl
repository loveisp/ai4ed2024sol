Let's assume that Tom's current age is T and Jerry's current age is J.\n4. From the information given, we can set up the following equations:\n    - T + 4 = 2T (equation 1)\n    - T - 3 = 10 - J - 3 (equation 2)\n5. Let's solve these equations to find the values of T and J.\n    - From equation 1, we can subtract T from both sides to get 4 = T.\n    - From equation 2, we can substitute T = 4 and solve for J.\n        - J - 3 = 10 - 4\n        - J - 3 = 6\n        - J = 6 + 3\n        - J = 9\n6. Now we know that Tom's current age is 4 and Jerry's current age is 9.\n7. To find out how many years from now Jerry's age will be doubled, we need to find the difference between Jerry's current age and double his current age.\n    - Double Jerry's current age is 2 * 9 = 18.\n    - The difference between Jerry's current age and double his current age is 18 - 9 = 9.\n8. Therefore, in 9 years from now, Jerry's age will be doubled.\n#### 9\nThe answer is: 9"}

The number contains the digit $3$ in the tens or units place.\nFor the first case, there are $3$ choices for the hundreds digit (3, 30, 300) and $9$ choices for each of the tens and units digits (0-9).\nSo, there are $3 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 9 = 243$ numbers in this case.\nFor the second case, there are $9$ choices for each of the hundreds, tens, and units digits (0-9).\nSo, there are $9 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 9 = 729$ numbers in this case.\nAdding the two cases together, we get $243 + 729 = 972$ numbers that contain the digit $3$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{972}$.The answer is: 972"}
