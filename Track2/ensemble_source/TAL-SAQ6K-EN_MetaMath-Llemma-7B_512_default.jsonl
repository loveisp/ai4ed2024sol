This means she spent $6500 - 30% of $6500 = $6500 - $2100 = $4400 to buy the sofa.\nIn the second scenario, she made a profit of $5000. To find her percentage of profit, we need to find what percentage $5000 is of the cost of the sofa.\nLet's call the cost of the sofa C.\nSo, $5000 is C - 30% of C.\nThis can be written as $5000 = C - 0.3C.\nSimplifying, we get $5000 = 0.7C.\nDividing both sides by 0.7, we find that C = $7142.857.\nNow we can find the percentage of profit in the second scenario.\nThe profit is $5000 and the cost of the sofa is $7142.857.\nSo, the percentage of profit is (profit / cost) * 100 = ($5000 / $7142.857) * 100 = 71.43%.\nTherefore, her percentage of profit in the second scenario is 71.43%.\nThe answer is: 71.43"}
