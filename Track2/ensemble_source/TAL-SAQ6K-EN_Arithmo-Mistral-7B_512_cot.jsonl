In the best-case scenario, each triangle intersects with every other triangle, creating a total of 10 intersections.\n\nSo, the maximum number of different parts we can divide the plane into is 5 + 10 = 15."}

We can rewrite the formula as:\n\nT_moon = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g_moon)\n\nWe want to find the period on the Moon, so we can set T_moon = 1 second:\n\n1 = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/(g/6))\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the pendulum on the Moon:\n\n1 = 2\u03c0\u221a(6L/g)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n1 = 12\u03c0\u00b2L/g\n\nMultiplying both sides by g:\n\ng = 12\u03c0\u00b2L\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of g on the Moon (g_moon = g/6):\n\ng_moon = 12\u03c0\u00b2L/6\n\nSimplifying:\n\ng_moon = 2\u03c0\u00b2L\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the period on the Moon is 1 second:\n\n1 = 2\u03c0\u221a(2\u03c0\u00b2L/g_moon)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n1 = 8\u03c0\u00b2L/g_moon\n\nMultiplying both sides by g_moon:\n\ng_moon = 8\u03c0\u00b2L\n\nSince g_moon = g/6, we can equate the two expressions for g_moon:\n\ng/6 = 8\u03c0\u00b2L\n\nSolving for L:\n\nL = (g/6) / 8\u03c0\u00b2\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of g on Earth (g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2):\n"}

The acceleration (a) due to gravity is -9.81 m/s^2 (downward direction is considered negative). The distance traveled (s) is the difference between the initial and final altitudes, which is 3,000 - 2,000 = 1,000 meters.\n\nWe want to find the final velocity (v) when the skydiver's altitude is 2,000 meters. Plugging the values into the equation, we get:\n\nv^2 = 0^2 + 2(-9.81)(1,000)\n\nv^2 = -19.62(1,000)\n\nv^2 = -19,620\n\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find the magnitude of the final velocity:\n\nv = \u221a(-19,620)\n\nv \u2248 -444.9 m/s\n\nSince the final velocity is negative, it means the skydiver is falling downward.

{"queId": "cf5ba5b483a144138738a1737ed5a419", "answer": " First, let's count the total number of ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"STATISTIC\" without any restrictions. There are 11 letters in the word, so there are 11! (11 factorial) ways to rearrange them. This is equal to 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 39,916,800 ways.\n\nNow, let's consider the restrictions. We want to make sure that no two T's are next to each other. We can think of this as placing the T's in the gaps between the other letters. There are 10 gaps in the word \"STATISTIC\" (including the gaps at the beginning and the end). We can place the 3 T's in these gaps in 10C3 (10 choose 3) ways. This is equal to 10! / (3! * 7!) = 120 ways.\n\nHowever, we have counted each valid arrangement twice (once for each possible placement of the T's). To correct for this, we divide by 2, giving us 120 / 2 = 60 valid arrangements.\n\nTherefore, there are 60 ways to rearrange the letters in the word \"STATISTIC\" such that no two T's are next to each other."}

{"queId": "407e3d4abdd84948b11417cc857b3a6f", "answer": " To find the percent concentration of nickel in the new metal, we need to find the total amount of nickel in the new metal and the total amount of metal in the new metal.\n\nLet's first find the amount of nickel in the first metal. Since it contains 45% nickel, we can multiply the total weight of the metal by the percentage of nickel:\n\nAmount of nickel in first metal = 45% * 6 mg = 0.45 * 6 mg = 2.7 mg\n\nNow let's find the amount of nickel in the second metal. Since it contains 60% nickel, we can multiply the total weight of the metal by the percentage of nickel:\n\nAmount of nickel in second metal = 60% * 14 mg = 0.60 * 14 mg = 8.4 mg\n\nNow we can find the total amount of nickel in the new metal by adding the amount of nickel in the first metal and the amount of nickel in the second metal:\n\nTotal amount of nickel in new metal = 2.7 mg + 8.4 mg = 11.1 mg\n\nNext, we need to find the total amount of metal in the new metal. We can do this by adding the total weight of the first metal and the total weight of the second metal:\n\nTotal amount of metal in new metal = 6 mg + 14 mg = 20 mg\n\nNow we can find the percent concentration of nickel in the new metal by dividing the total amount of nickel in the new metal by the total amount of metal in the new metal and multiplying by 100:\n\nPercent concentration of nickel in new metal = (11.1 mg / 20 mg) * 100 = 55.5%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 55.5%."}

If we use 9 small boxes, we would have 9 * 5 = 45 apples.\nSince we need 54 apples, we need to add 9 more apples. We can do this by using 3 medium boxes, which would give us 3 * 7 = 21 apples.\nSo, the combination of 9 small boxes and 3 medium boxes would give us a total of 45 + 21 = 66 apples.\nSince we only need 54 apples, we can subtract 66 - 54 = 12 apples from the total.\nTo make up for the 12 apples, we can use 2 large boxes, which would give us 2 * 10 = 20 apples.\nTherefore, the smallest number of boxes Ryan can buy is 9 small boxes + 3 medium boxes + 2 large boxes = 14 boxes.\nThe answer is: 14"}

We can write the given conditions as:\n\\[n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\]\n\\[n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\]\n\\[n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}\\]\nTo find the least possible value of $n$, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\nFrom the first condition, we have $n = 7a + 2$ for some integer $a$.\nSubstituting this into the second condition, we have $7a + 2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}$.\nSimplifying, we get $7a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of $7$ modulo $9$, which is $7$, we get $a \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$.\nSo, $a = 9b + 7$ for some integer $b$.\nSubstituting this into the first expression for $n$, we have $n = 7(9b + 7) + 2 = 63b + 49$.\nFinally, substituting this into the third condition, we have $63b + 49 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$.\nSimplifying, we get $63b \\equiv 4 - 49 \\equiv -45 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$.\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of $63$ modulo $11$, which is $4$, we get $b \\equiv 4 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{11}$.\nSo, $b = 11c + 8$ for some integer $c$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $n$, we have $n = 63(11c + 8) + 49 = 693c + 517$.\nThe least possible value of $n$ is when $c = 0$, so $n = 693(0) + 517 = \\boxed{517}$.\nThe answer is: 517"}
